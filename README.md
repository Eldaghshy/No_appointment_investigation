# No_appointment_investigation
It is an investigation of trying to figure out why 30% of patients in Brazil don't show up to their scheduled appointment.

You will find the notebook is split into introduction which I introduce the dataset to the user and ask some questions that needed to have answers through investigation.
  =The reason I made this investigation in Jupyter notebook is to let me and the user have clear view of the dataset and its visualizations.

This was done on 3 parts:

1- Data wrangling: where I cleaned the collected data from the invalid values and correcting the type of data found in the variables of the dataset to prepare it for investigation.

2- Data visualization: which was done on 2 steps for 2 main reasons
  a)To see the distribution of each of the patients' characteristics in the dataset. (1D visualization)
  b)To look for a relationship or a correlation between each variable and patient not showing up to their appointments. (2D visualization)
  
3- Conclusion where I present the result of this investigation along with the limitations and diffculties I faced during investigating 
    =to let the viewer have more clear understanding of the nature of this investigation and its conclusion.
